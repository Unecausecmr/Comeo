# Pivotal Tracker Guideline

Pivotal Tracker is not as complex as Jira, and not as simple as Trello. It is a sweet spot!


### Sections

Icebox - tasks brainstorming area. Possible to leave there tasks with prelimenary description. Or task stubs which may be removed later.

Backlog - tasks, sorted by priorities.

Current - TODO tasks with clarified requirements, development focus.

Epics – container for several user stories united by common context.

### Tasks types
Chore - tasks related to refactoring and minor modifications of existing functionality.  
User story - tasks for new feature implementation.

## General flow

There are no sprints, until it will not be possible to continue without them.  
There is current section, which should be refilled when it contains less than 3 tasks.

### Loop
Add task to Icebox, with draft description.  
Move task to backlog.  
Refine requirements.  
Move task to current.  
Start and mark task as finished.  
Check definition of done.  
Mark task as accepted.  
Deploy.
